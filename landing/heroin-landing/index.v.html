                    <h2>Heroin Addiction Treatment at Flatirons Recovery</h2>
                    <p>Over the past 15 years, heroin and opiate use has become an epidemic of significant proportions in the United States, impacting communities from nearly every socioeconomic category in tragic ways. Many researchers have estimated that the number of people currently using heroin for the first time is nearly double the number of people in 2006, due in large part to the over prescription of opioids.</p>
                    <p>Post-detox, treatment for Heroin Use Disorder at Flatirons Recovery typically begins in our <a href="/treatment/php/">PHP/Day Treatment</a> program for a period of at least 4 weeks.</p>
                    <p>From there, clients often step-down into our <a href="/treatment/iop/">IOP</a> for a period of 4-12 weeks, while continuing to work with their therapeutic team on a plan to address support needs that will be crucial to maintaining recovery after structured treatment ends.</p>
