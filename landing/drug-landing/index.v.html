                    <h2>Our Drug Addiction Program</h2>
                    <p>People who struggle with drug addiction are unique individuals and have vastly different experiences, personality traits, genes, sociocultural influences, educations, races, and ethnicities. While drug addiction can often seem like a hopeless and devastating disease, many people who struggle with drug addiction make completely full recoveries – no matter if they’ve been to treatment one time or 20 times.</p>
                    <p>At Flatirons Recovery, we emphasize and utilize a variety of evidence-based therapeutic approaches – including cognitive-behavioral therapies and other forms of therapy that involve physiological training in anxiety reduction and increased impulse control (which can lead to enhanced decision-making skills); psychological and behavioral strategies to practice interpersonal communication skills and develop the ability to tolerate distressing situations; and, of course, mindfulness training, which is a neuroscientifically-based modality being used to address conditions ranging from addiction to chronic pain to cancer.</p>
