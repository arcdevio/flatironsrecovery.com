                    <h2>Our Alcohol Addiction Program</h2>
                    <p>People who struggle with alcohol are unique individuals and have vastly different experiences, personality traits, genes, sociocultural influences, educations, races, and ethnicities. While alcoholism can often seem like a hopeless and devastating disease, many people who struggle with alcohol addiction make completely full recoveries – no matter if they’ve been to treatment one time or 20 times.</p>
                    <p>At Flatirons Recovery, we emphasize and utilize a variety of evidence-based therapeutic approaches – including cognitive-behavioral therapies and other forms of therapy that involve physiological training in anxiety reduction and increased impulse control (which can lead to enhanced decision-making skills); psychological and behavioral strategies to practice interpersonal communication skills and develop the ability to tolerate distressing situations; and, of course, mindfulness training, which is a neuroscientifically-based modality being used to address conditions ranging from addiction to chronic pain to cancer.</p>

                    <p>Those struggling with alcohol addiction often spend a great deal of time drinking alcohol in their home environments.</p>
                    <p>For those considering engaging in treatment while continuing to live at home, this poses significant challenges for maintaining sobriety. Our sober living facilities emphasize our belief that active connection to community is a foundational aspect of long-term recovery. As such, clients in our sober living are encouraged to take on mentoring roles with new peers, as well as to begin involvement in community-based recovery programs such as 12-step and SMART Recovery.</p>
