                    Cocaine Addiction
                    The 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports that in the past year approximately 5.5 million people in the
                    United States used cocaine, including approximately 750,000 users of crack cocaine. This same study found that “3.5
                    million adults aged 26 or older used cocaine in the past year, including 666,000 who used crack.” The percentage of
                    adults in this age group in 2018 who used cocaine in the past year was higher than the percentages in most years from
                    2011 to 2015, but it was similar to the percentages in 2016 and 2017. The estimate of past year crack use in 2018 among
                    adults aged 26 or older was lower than estimates in 2002 to 2008, but it was similar to the estimates in 2009 to 2017.”
                    
                    This same study found that about 977,000 people aged 12 or older in 2018 met clinical criteria for a diagnosis of
                    Cocaine Use Disorder in the past year, equating to approximately 0.4 percent of the population of the United States. The
                    study also determined that this percentage of people was relatively consistent with percentages found in studies from
                    2009 to 2017, but lower than the percentages from 2002 to 2008.
