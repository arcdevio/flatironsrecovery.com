    <h2>Prescription Medication Addiction</h2>
    <p>One of the steepest barriers to people entering treatment for prescription medications is the belief that if a medical doctor has prescribed it, that it cannot be harmful. However, addiction to powerful prescription medications such as Oxycontin, Klonopin, or Adderall can be just as--if not more--problematic than typical street drugs. Among the 8.1 million people that the 2018 <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018.pdf" target="_blank">National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a> estimates had an illicit drug use disorder, <em>“the most common disorders were for marijuana (4.4 million) and misuse of prescription pain relievers (1.7 million).”</em></p>

    <h3>Common prescriptions medications that people enter into substance use disorders treatment for include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Benzodiazepines (Klonopin, Xanax, Valium)</li>
        <li>Opioids (Dilaudid, Fentanyl, Morphine, Oxycodone, Oxycontin, Percocet, and Vicodin)</li>
        <li>Stimulants (Adderall, Ritalin)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to tell if you or a loved one is using prescription medications problematically?</h4>
    <p>The following criteria come from the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) released by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prescription medication is taken in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than was intended.</li>
        <li>A persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control prescription medication use.</li>
        <li>A great deal of time is spent in activities, necessary to obtain prescription medication, use, or recover from its effects.</li>
        <li>Craving or a strong desire or urge to use prescription medication.</li>
        <li>Recurrent prescription medication use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school or home.</li>
        <li>Continued prescription medication use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of prescription drugs.</li>
        <li>Recurrent prescription medication use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.</li>
        <li>Prescription medication is continued despite knowledge of having persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problems likely to have been caused or exacerbated by prescription drugs.</li>
        <li>Physical or psychological issues that are likely to have been caused or exacerbated by prescription medication use.</li>
        <li>High tolerance for prescription medication.</li>
        <li>Withdrawal symptoms experienced without using prescription medications.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you or a loved one’s prescription drug use meet at least two of these criteria in the past 12 months, then you may be suffering from a substance use disorder requiring treatment.</p>
