Flatirons COVID-19

At Flatirons Recovery Center we have stringent infectious disease screening for any potential client who wishes to admit to our program.
Please see the following screening questions:
Have you been in direct contact with any person who has been identified as a confirmed case of COVID-19 or is currently on the CDC list as a Person Under Investigation for COVID-19?
Have you experienced any of the following symptoms (unrelated to substance use withdrawals):
Upper respiratory distress including dry or productive cough?
Sore Throat?
Shortness of Breath?
Fever?
In the past 14 days have you traveled outside of the US to China, Iran, Japan, Europe, South Korea?
In the past 14 days have you traveled to an area in the United States currently experiencing outbreaks of COVID-19, especially the states of Arizona, Texas, California, or Florida?
If you have answered yes to any of the above questions and/ or are experiencing these symptoms and they arenâ€™t otherwise linked to withdrawals, Flatirons Recovery Center requires a confirmatory test for COVID 19 prior to entry into treatment.

Additionally, if potential clients are accessing detoxification services prior to admission into Flatirons Recovery Center, we will work with those facilities to assist clients in accessing COVID-19 testing whether they are symptomatic, or not.

Once admitted into the care of Flatirons Recovery Center, all new clients will be asked to submit to COVID-19 swab testing at the time of admission, asked to wear a facemask, and will be educated on symptom identification and personal hygiene protocols followed within the facility.

Tips for Staying Healthy
As with other respiratory illnesses, there are steps that everyone can take daily to reduce the risk of getting sick or infecting others with circulating viruses. You should:
Stay home when you are sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use hand sanitizer, as provided. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Limit close contact, like kissing and sharing cups or utensils, with people who are sick.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipes
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If you do not have a tissue, use your sleeve (not your hands).
Use a facemask when you are not able to appropriately socially distance yourself.
Get a flu shot to prevent influenza if you have not done so this season.
