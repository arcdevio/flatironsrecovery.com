    <h3>Tips for Staying Healthy</h3>
    <p>As with other respiratory illnesses, there are steps that everyone can take daily to reduce the risk of getting sick or infecting others with circulating viruses. You should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
        <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
        <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use hand sanitizer, as provided. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
        <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
        <li>Limit close contact, like kissing and sharing cups or utensils, with people who are sick.</li>
        <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipes</li>
        <li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. If you do not have a tissue, use your sleeve (not your hands).</li>
        <li>Use a facemask when you are not able to appropriately socially distance yourself.</li>
        <li>Get a flu shot to prevent influenza if you have not done so this season.</li>
    </ul>
