            <p>At Flatirons Recovery, clients can expect compassionate, evidence-based treatment for addiction and any co-occurring mental health disorders. Our treatment team focuses on healing the whole individual, instead of focusing on one specific area of a person’s life that may be problematic, in order to provide clients with more opportunity to maintain long-term sobriety. </p>
            <p>We do this by working collaboratively with clients to develop an action plan for relapse prevention, heal trauma, learn skills to more successfully cope with mental health challenges, eat healthier, get more consistent exercise, have fun in recovery, and stay connected to a supportive sober community.</p>
