    <p>Holistic addiction treatment refers to the practice of treating the individual as a whole. We consider methamphetamine addiction to be a coping mechanism for deeper issues in a person’s life, such as underlying depression, anxiety, stress, or trauma. For this reason, we find it essential for long-term recovery to address the various aspects of a person’s life that may be in need of healing while treating our clients for substance abuse disorders. Our goal is to set our clients on a path towards recovery that includes all facets of their wellbeing: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. Holistic treatment includes not only recognizing the root cause of the addiction and making a plan towards healing it, but also helping a person to thrive in all areas of their lives through community, creativity, nutrition, exercise, recreation, spiritual practice, and life skills.</p> 

    <h2>What is Methamphetamine?</h2>
	<p>Methamphetamine is an illicit manufactured stimulant that is highly addictive and physically damaging. Also known as meth, crystal meth, ice, and blue, methamphetamine takes the form of a white, odorless powder that can be snorted, smoked, orally ingested, or injected. As a stimulant, methamphetamine causes racing thoughts, increased activity, talkativeness, decreased appetite, and a sense of euphoric well-being. When smoked or injected, methamphetamine enters the bloodstream very quickly, though only lasts a short period of time. The “high” of meth frequently wears out long before it has left a person’s bloodstream, prompting its user to use more and more to maintain this sense of wellbeing. </p>

    <h2>What are the negative effects of using methamphetamine?</h2>
	<p>In the short term, methamphetamine use can cause a wide array of cardiovascular problems, such as increased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and irregular heart beat. In cases of overdose, a person can experience seizures, hyperthermia (increased body temperature), and death. Meth also releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter that trains the brain to repeat usage to achieve the same sense of pleasure, thereby putting users at high risk of addiction. People who use methamphetamine long term may see increased irritability, insomnia, mood swings, confusion, anxiety, and violent behavior. Some may experience forms of psychosis such as delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations. Long term use can also cause changes to the brain such as affected cognitive function, memory, mental flexibility, neurotoxicity, and motor speed, as well as physical ailments such as weight loss and dental and skin problems. </p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment for Methamphetamine Addiction</h2>
	<p>Before engaging in treatment for methamphetamine addiction, it is necessary to engage in medical detoxification. We partner with excellent medical detox facilities throughout Colorado and beyond to assure you are able to safely clear your body of methamphetamine. Our clinical staff can help determine the level of care necessary for your treatment once methamphetamine detox is complete. It is common to stay 30-90 days in our facility while engaging in a holistic treatment model at our center located in Boulder County, Colorado. We use a wide array of evidenced-based treatment tailored to each individual’s needs during their time with us, including but not limited to mindfulness, CBT and DBT for relapse prevention, EMDR for addressing underlying trauma, ACT, MI, biofeedback, nutritional counseling, and experiential therapies such as art therapy, yoga, equine therapy, and nature-based therapeutic outings such as hiking and rock climbing. In addition to our clinical programming, clients who stay in our structured sober living facility located on a peaceful Colorado horse farm receive around the clock staff support and supervision, as well as additional programming to help develop life skills and community.</p>
