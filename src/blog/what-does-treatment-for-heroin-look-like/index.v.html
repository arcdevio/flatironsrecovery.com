    <h2>What is Heroin?</h2>

    <p>Heroin is a narcotic in the opiate family that originates from morphine. Heroin is an illicit drug that is sold in a white, brown, or black powder. Heroin can be injected, snorted, or smoked. Because of its potency, it can result in quick addiction as well as overdose and death. </p>

    <h3>Why is Heroin so Addictive?</h3>
    <p>Like other opiates, heroin releases dopamine by binding to receptors in the brain. Once someone begins taking heroin regularly, the brain ceases to produce dopamine as it once did, and the user becomes dependent on heroin in higher and higher quantities to achieve the same feeling of wellbeing. </p>
    <p>It is common for people to first become addicted to other prescription opiates they may have been given for treatment of pain following surgery or injury. Once their prescription is no longer available, many seek heroin illicitly to achieve the feeling they once had from these medications. Heroin is usually less expensive and easier to obtain illicitly than prescription opioids. </p>

    <h3>What Does Treatment for Heroin Addiction Look Like?</h3>
    <p>When treating <a href="/addiction/heroin">heroin addiction</a>, it professional medical detox is needed first and foremost. The withdrawal from heroin addiction can be severe. Withdrawal symptoms include muscle cramps, anxiety, severe depression, fever, nausea, vomiting, suicidal ideation, and cravings. Medical detox is an inpatient service that manages and guides people safely through these withdrawal symptoms. In some cases, certain medications such as suboxone, vivitrol, and methadone can prescribed to ease withdrawal symptoms as well. If you are receiving treatment with Flatirons Recovery for heroin addiction, we partner with excellent medical detox providers in the area for this portion of treatment.</p>
    <p>Once medical detox is complete, clients can begin treatment at Flatirons Recovery. Heroin addiction treatment typically lasts for 30-90 days of day treatment programming, which includes group therapy, individual therapy, medication management, and experiential programming such as yoga, art, and outdoor activities. While participating in day treatment, clients are encouraged to reside in our structured sober living facility, where they will be accommodated with full staff support, transportation, food, and additional community and recreational programming. Once complete, clients can also “step down” into our intensive outpatient programming, which includes 10-16 hours of group and individual therapy a week while they re-integrate back into their lives, looking towards long-term recovery. </p>
