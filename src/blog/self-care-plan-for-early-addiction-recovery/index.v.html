    <h2>Why Writing Down a Self-Care Plan is Essential in Addiction Recovery</h2>
    <p>Making room for self care practices in addiction recovery is not only helpful, it is essential. Far too often, when we are in the greatest moments of suffering, we find ourselves more prone to ignoring or harming ourselves rather than loving and nurturing ourselves. Setting the intention to practice self-love and self-care instead of self-neglect or self-harm is a powerful way to build a foundation from which we can heal and thrive.</p>
    
    <h2>So why write it down?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we need that reassurance that it is ok to put ourselves first, that it is not selfish to take care of ourselves, and that we are worth the time, energy, and money we invest in ourselves. And sometimes that reassurance has to come from within. We have to remind ourselves, over and over, that we are valuable and important. When we put something on paper, we hold ourselves accountable. We make a deal with ourselves that is visible, tangible, and alive in the world outside of our own brains.</p>
    <p>Having a tangible plan also makes it way easier to implement, especially in moments of crisis. When we are depressed, panicking, or triggered, the last thing our brains want to do is to try to figure out a way to feel better. If it feels like too daunting a task, that’s because often times, it is. Having a healthy list of options ready to go takes the pressure off of figuring it out in the moment.</p>
    <p>Lastly, when you put the intention into writing it down, you can make sure you cover all aspects of self-care so that you can achieve a more holistic wellbeing. Does your list include caring practices for your physical, social, emotional, intellectual, creative, and spiritual selves? If you are not sure what each of these parts of you need to thrive, making a list of possibilities is a way of listening to them.</p>
