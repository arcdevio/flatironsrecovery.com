                    <p>Meditation for recovery is a free, weekly drop- in class open to our community. Whether you are brand new to mediation,
                    curious about how the practice may apply to life in recovery, or a seasoned mediator looking to take a weekly
                    mindfulness break with other like- minded individuals, this class is for you! No prior mediation experience necessary.</p>

                    <p>We will open each group with a brief introduction to the practice and discussion of a weekly aspect of mediation and its
                    application to life in recovery. This will be followed by a 30 min meditation intermittent guidance.</p>

                    <p>Join us every Tuesday evening! No registration required.</p>
