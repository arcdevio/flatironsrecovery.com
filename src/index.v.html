                    <h3>What Treatment Looks Like at Flatirons Recovery</h3>
                    <p>At Flatirons Recovery, clients can expect compassionate, evidence-based treatment for substance use and <a href="/mental-health">dual-diagnosis disorders</a>.</p>
                    <p>Our treatment team focuses on healing the whole individual, instead of focusing on one specific area of a person’s life that may be problematic. We do this by working with clients to develop action plans for relapse prevention, beginning to heal trauma, learning skills for more successful coping with mental health challenges, eating healthier, getting more consistent exercise, and having fun in recovery.</p>
