    <p>Those struggling with addiction often spend a great deal of time using alcohol or other drugs in their home environments. For those considering engaging in treatment while continuing to live at home, this poses significant challenges for maintaining sobriety.</p>
    <p>Flatirons Recovery’s structured, gender-specific sober living affords clients a comfortable, supportive environment in which to engage in addiction treatment, away from the people, places, and things contributing to a person’s addiction, while creating an action plan for addressing those environmental and relational challenges in healthier ways.</p>
    <p>Our sober living facilities emphasize our belief that active connection to community is a foundational aspect of long-term recovery. As such, clients in our sober living are encouraged to take on mentoring roles with new peers, as well as to begin involvement in community-based recovery programs such as 12-step and SMART Recovery.</p>
    <p>For those clients wishing to continue living in a sober living community after the completion of treatment at Flatirons Recovery, our team works to match our clients up with sober living programs who share our mission of helping people to recover from addiction.</p>
